                So far, my journey in my program and the IT field has been really exciting, and I'm glad I picked this field.
                Going to Four Rivers Career Center for vocational school gave me hands-on experience every day, and earning
                certifications like Testout PC Pro and Network Pro made me feel prepared for college level IT classes. I really 
                enjoyed learning practical skills, like building computers and setting up networks, that I know I'll use in 
                the future. Now that I'm at Mizzou, I'm looking forward to exploring everything the program has to offer and 
                seeing how far I can push myself.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Some of the most important skills I've learned include identifying computer components, building and taking 
                apart PCs, configuring networks and servers, and spotting threats or vulnerabilities in a system. I've also
                gotten better at solving problems logically and thinking through issues step by step. One thing I've realized
                is that knowing the theory is one thing, but actually putting it into practice like troubleshooting a network 
                or figuring out why a program isn't working teaches you more then any textbook could.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest challenges I've faced were the large projects in my cybersecurity class. They required teamwork, 
                planning, and making sure everyone did their part. Sometimes coordinating with teammates was tricky, but it taught
                me how to communicate better and work with different personalities. Looking back, those projects weren't just about
                cybersecurity, they were about learning how to collaborate and handle real world problems with a group.
            </p>

            <p>
                Right now, my main goal is to land an IT of cybersecurity internship while I'm at Mizzou so I can get real world
                experience. After I graduate, I want to work in the IT department of a big company, hopefully on their cybersecurity
                team as an analyst. I also plan to keep learning, whether that's through certifications, training, or hands-on projects,
                so I can grow as a professional. Ultimately, I want to build a solid foundation in IT and cybersecurity while gaining 
                the experience I'll need to succeed in my career.
