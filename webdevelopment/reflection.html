            <p class="intro">
                So far, my journey in my program and the IT field as a whole has been a very good experience, 
                and I am glad I chose the field that I did. I enjoyed my time attending Four Rivers Career Center, 
                gaining valuable skills every day, and gaining certifications has given me a significant advantage coming 
                into my major here at Mizzou. Currently, I am excited to see what the program here will offer me. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                Key Skills and lessons I have learned are being able to correctly identify the components of most computers
                and being able to build them and take them apart, being able to configure a network and server, identifying 
                threats to a network, identifying vulnerabilities in a system, and having good problem-solving skills overall 
            </p>

            <p>
                Challenges I have faced were the big projects that me and my team and in my cybersecurity class had to overcome 
                as part of the course which involved collaboration and teamwork to overcome. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My career goals are to land an IT/Cybersecurity internship in my upcoming years of education here at Mizzou and 
                once I graduate, secure a job in the IT division of a major company, becoming a part of their Cybersecurity team 
                becoming an analyst
