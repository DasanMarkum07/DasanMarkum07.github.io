                <p>
                    This was the first certification I earned in my first semester of 
                    junior year of high school in the first year information technology 
                    program at Four Rivers Career Center. This certification shows I 
                    mastered the basic fundamental concepts of the physical hardware 
                    side of information technology. I learned about all the components 
                    that make up a computer and how each of them works, such as CPUs, 
                    memory, storage, power supplies, motherboards, and any other physical 
                    component required for a computer to function. I received the 
                    certification through the company Testout before it was purchased by CompTIA

                    Career Center. This certification shows I mastered the basic fundamental concepts 
                    of networking and server management, understanding network architecture, and how 
                    networks operate together. I received the certification from the same company

                <p>
                    I graduated from Wright City High School, and received my diploma for my K-12 
                    education, where I learned and mastered everything required by the Missouri Board 
                    of Education. This foundation for all the concepts and fundamentals I need to 
                    succeed in College

                <h2>Job Experience: Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Cashier</h2>
                <img src="popeyes.png" alt="Popeyes Logo">

                <p>
                    I worked at a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen located inside of a Travel Centers 
                    of America truck stop located in Foristell, Missouri for over a year as a cashier. 
                    I gained valuable customer service skills and learned to work effectively in a 
                    fast-paced environment to ensure things ran smoothly. My general manager favored 
                    me for my work ethic and was sad to see me leave as a result of going to college.
