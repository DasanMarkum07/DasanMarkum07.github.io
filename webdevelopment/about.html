        <h3>Short Bio</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Dasan Markum, I am 18 years old, and I am from a small town in Missouri called Wright City. 
            I attended the Wright City R-2 School District for my entire K-12 career. For my Junior and Senior years
            of High School, I attended vocational school at Four Rivers Career Center, located in Washington, Missouri, 
            where I completed the first year Information Technology program and earned a Testout PC Pro Certification 
            and a Network Pro Certification, and the second year Cybersecurity program. I am currently a freshman here 
            at the University of Missouri (Columbia), and I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology.  
            My hobbies include finding unreleased music and importing it into my Apple Music library to create a massive 
            collection of unreleased music, staying up to date on the latest tech trends and learning about new breakthroughs.</p>
